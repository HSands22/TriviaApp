    //both declared as Strings, since nothing else will be in there

//variable for our array index - Int
//variable for number of right answers - Int
//variable for number of wrong answers - Int
//variable to act as a flag if the user reaches the end of the quiz - Int or Boolean or String

//FUNCTION - checking the users answer. This will check if the String sent from the ViewController (ie, the user's answer) matches the String from the array of Question structs (ie, the answer)
    //FORM: func function_name(user's answer (ie a String) -> returns a true or false
    //conditional statement that will return true if user's answer matches, false if not

//FUNCTION - retrieving the questions text from the array of Question structs
    //FORM: func functions_name() -> returns question (ie String)

//FUNCTION - Retrieves user's progress (question number / total number of questions)
    //FORM: func functions_name() -> returns a number (ie Float)

//FUNCTION - retrieves user's score (score right / total number of answers)
    //FORM: func functions_name -> This could a String ("this is your score...") or could just be a number (ie Float)

//FUNCTION - updates the variable that is acting as our array index (we need a "pointer" that will keep track of where in the array we are). Useful for knowing what question we're on and when the quiz is over.
    //FORM: func function_name()
