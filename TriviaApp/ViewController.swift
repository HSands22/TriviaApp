        //VERY SIMILIAR TO SETUP() IN PROCESSING

        //UPDATEUI WILL SETUP EVERYTHING FOR THE REST OF THE CODE TO WORK
    }

        //CLEAR ANY COLOR CHANGES (FOR INSTANCE, IF THE COLOR CHANGES WHEN USER GETS QUESTION RIGHT/WRONG, WE WANT THE COLOR TO CHANGE BACK AFTER THEY ANSWER THE QUESTION
        
        //UPDATE THE PROGRESS BAR
        
        //UPDATE THE QUESTION THAT APPEARS ON SCREEN
        
        //CONDITIONAL THAT WILL CHECK IF THE QUIZ IS OVER. SOME KIND ON SCREEN FEEDBACK SHOULD HAPPEN AT THIS POINT. DISPLAY SCORE, CONGRATULATE THE PLAYER, ETC
        
        
    }
    
    //IBACTION FUNCTION (TRUE AND FALSE BUTTONS SHOULD BE LINKED TO THIS FUNCTION)
    
            //STORE THE CURRENTTITLE OF THE BUTTON IN A VARIABLE
    
            //CHECK THE ANSWER USING QUIZBRAIN
    
            //CONDITIONAL STATEMENT THAT WILL:
                //CHANGE THE BUTTONS COLOR DEPENDING IF THEY GOT IT RIGHT OR WRONG
                //UPDATE THE SCORE VARIABLES
                //INFORM THE USER IF THEY GOT IT RIGHT OR WRONG
            
            //USE A TIMER TO CALL UPDATEUI() TO CHANGE ON SCREEN ELEMENTS (UPDATE QUESTION TEXT, PROGRESS, SCORE, ETC). ITS A GOOD IDEA TO USE A TIMER SO WE CAN CONTROL HOW LONG THE COLOR CHANGES. EXAMPLE: USER PRESSES THE BUTTON->BUTTON COLOR CHANGES->TIMER FOR # OF SECONDS->CALL UPDATEUI() USING TIMER. REVIEW MUSICAPP FOR MORE REVIEW
    
            //GO TO THE NEXT QUESTION
