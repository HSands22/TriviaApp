For our first project, we will be coding a trivia app! Trivia apps are always fun to play around with. They teach us something new while being very entertaining! 

Projects are different than our weekly homework. I will not provide as much starting code and there will be greater freedom for you to work on your own.

-------------------------------------

DUE DATES:

4/30 CHECK-IN: Designed to check your progress and give you feedback.

5/7 SUBMISSION DATE:  Final project due. Complete all requirements and submit before class.

TRIVIA APP - CORE FEATURES - **ALL SUBMITTED PROJECTS MUST INCLUDE ALL OF THE FOLLOWING**

TRIVIA QUESTION BANK:

-Because we are a Quaker school, the principles of Equity, Peace, and Community are staunchly upheld.  The ideas of social justice does not have to be constrained only in our Humanities classes, but can be applied everything we do in life. Programming included!

-Since we are community that is active in promoting social justice, I'm asking you to create apps that take on that same purpose. For this project, you will be creating a Trivia App that promotes social justice or raises awareness around a social issue. 

-The question bank will focus around a societal issue you want people to become more active in (or just raise awareness around). You will choose an issue, research it, and design at least 20 trivia questions.

-You may use any available resource, but make sure you cite where they come from!

DESIGN in Storyboard:

The app must have the following:

-TRUE and FALSE buttons (buttons should change color when pressed or have some other kind of visual feedback for the user. Timer functions are great for this). NOTE: IF you are on the ADVANCED track and choose multiple choice or user answers using keyboard, then you are exempt from this requirement)
-At least one OTHER BUTTON (a reset/replay button would be pretty useful! But, feel free to be creative. As long as the button's behavior fits into the design of your app)
-At least two TEXT LABELS (visual feedback for the user. If the user gets a question right, we should inform the user in some way. Timer functions are great for this)
-PROGRESS BAR (I will talk about how to do this in class)
-SOUND EFFECTS (add at least one somewhere)
-FINAL SCORE (once the user finishes the game their score should appear on screen)
-TEXT LABEL for author (your name and any other information you choose). BONUS if you can create a pop-up or separate screen. 
-ALL ON-SCREEN OBJECTS (background, labels, text, etc) must have thought-out design elements. Deliberate choices of colors, fonts, shadows, alignment, etc.

PROGRAMMING in ViewController:

-Be sure to link everything in the Storyboard to the ViewController. 

-I've pushed an xcode project you can work of that includes the basic structure of the code.

**ADVANCED TRACK** - YOU MUST CHOOSE AT LEAST TWO: 

DESIGN :

-Implement an auto-layout in your Storyboard so your app works in landscape mode. (USE THIS TUTORIAL TO GET STARTED WITH AUTO-LAYOUT)

ART : Design and use your own art assets (pictures, words, etc) for your Storyboard. This must be original art content that you made yourself. 

-There are many image editing applications and you are free to use whatever you prefer. If you do not have access to this kind of software there are many free versions out there. GIMP is a great Photoshop alternative and can be downloaded for free.

CODE: Refactor the project and add more features

-user can type their own answers (ie, String matching)
-implement a multiple choice (refactor the structs)
-add animations (should be kept simple and basic. Here's a good tutorial to get you started)
-add a answer timer (if user takes too long to answer there's a penalty)
-CHOOSE YOUR OWN FEATURE! If you have an idea you are free to pursue it. HOWEVER, you must get approval from me first.
